The [mapbox updating choropleth example](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/updating-choropleth/) uses a precomputed legend: both the stops and the colors they correspond to are already written into the webpage. In maps that follow Tobler's law that "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things", some regions will contain features that have small but significant differences from each other that are difficult to see on a pre-computed legend. Here are two solutions: change the style and change the legend to match the displayed data (`adapt_style` and `adapt_legend.js`, respectively).
